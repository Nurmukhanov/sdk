## The artifact (For our lovely JDK 6, mostly because of Android)
    <groupId>walkingdevs</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
    <version>6-SNAPSHOT</version>

## Why?
- Cut down boilerplate code and noise
- Increase expressiveness
- Be more functional
- Be more object oriented
- Be less procedural

## What's included
- HTTP client
- Byte, String, Stream ~~utility~~ classes

## TODO
- Functional arrays
- JSON
- Small mockable, embeddable HTTP server

## Philosophy
Programming isn't an Art, but it does not mean that it can be ugly.
Man who loves programming will love to write beautiful code too.
It's hard to write good code with JDK. I hope that this artifact will
help someone to write a better code.
